Hello there.


Auth Management
================

Tools to convert credentials into authentication and authorization in raw
Python, as opposed to the Python APIs provided by `keystoneauth1` or the
like. They were largely created out of frustration with the apparent
moving target and inconsistencies of the OS client APIs, which was also
exacerbated by the Blazar client being fairly nacent.
